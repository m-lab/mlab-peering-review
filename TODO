Stage 1
=======

 * create IP filters from ISPs in GeoIPASNum2 to get raw NDT results
 * input: isp names, geoipasnum2, 
 * intermediate: stage1-per-isp-asn-filters
 * output: stage1-per-isp-site-raw-downloads (sip, cip, ts, bw)

Stage 2
=======

 * create filters from raw results of stage 1 (sip, cip, ts) to extract
   (sip, cip, ts, test_id)
 * input: stage1-per-isp-site-raw-downloads (which include isp name)
 * intermediate: stage2-filters-from-stage1-per-isp-raw-download
 * output: stage2-per-isp-site-testids (sip', cip, ts, test_id)

Stage 3
=======

 * create filters from raw results of stage 2 (sip, cip, ts, test_id) to extract
   all hops for test_id (sip, cip, test_id, h1...hn)
 * input: stage2-per-isp-site-testids
 * intermediate: stage3-filters-from-stage2
 * output: stage3-per-isp-site-hops (sip', [h1, ... hn], cip, ts, test_id)

Graph Types
===========

 * raw scatter plots - take raw ndt download rates (for a given site/isp) and
   scatter plot them.
    - one isp per plot:  prefix.site.isp.png

 * simple path diagrams - get to hops.py then execute diagrams.sh
    - one diagram per isp: prefix.site.isp.

 * post-hops scatter plots - take the samples identified by ts_hops and
   scatter plot them.  Like raw scatter plots, but "filtered" by diagram
   paths.  plots.sh begins to automate this process.

 * other combinations of sites/isps/whathaveyou. - custom.sh


Comparisons
===========

The above steps will generate the raw data for traffic from isps to specific
sites.  Comparitive analysis will be more interesting.

# Basically, this is Cogent vs Internap in ONE CITY x TWO SITES

NewYork : comcast     : lga01->comcast     vs lga02->comcast
NewYork : cablevision : lga01->cablevision vs lga02->cablevision
NewYork : verizon     : lga01->verizon     vs lga02->verizon
NewYork : time warner : lga01->time warner vs lga02->time warner 

SanFrancisco : comcast : nuq01->comcast    vs nuq02->comcast
SanFrancisco : cox     : nuq01->cox        vs nuq02->cox    

# Basically, A vs B in ONE CITY x ONE SITE

LAX - cox,charter vs comcast, or verizon, or timewarner
DFW - cox, vs comcast, or att, verizone, timewarner

ORD - comcast, charter, warner (all good performance)
NUQ - comcast, cox, (sort of charter, verizon, warner)

ATL - charter, comcast, cox, verizon, warner
IAD - comcast, verizon, warner

# MULTIPLE CITIES - ONE ISP
